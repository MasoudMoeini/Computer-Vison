# Resolution Refinement for Enlarged Scale Images Using GANs
- IRgan.ipynb file illustrates the input data preprocessing <br>
- FinalEvaluation_Main.ipynb file contains prediction model with GANs(two stream of CNN using tensorflow) and visulization 


1)Clone repository codes, (Reference dataset CIFAR-10 https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html ) already was unpacked and included in reposity<br>
2)Run file: IRgan.ipynb  to prepare input data for purposed GANs model.<br>
3)Run Main file: FinalEvaluation_Main.ipynb <br>

**please do not hesistate to share with me your constructive criticisms (Masoud.Moeini@Studium.uni-hamburg.de).

# Resolution Refinement for Enlarged Scale Images Using GANs
 
Recent innovations in Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in computer vision 
has enabled us to develop sophisticated methods to improve traditional approaches.
Based on CIFAR10 dataset,I developed a novel method in order to get high resolution version of enlarged 
scale images from low scale images by ap- plying unsupervised deep learning approach. 
The idea is that based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) we assume the input for
network is sequences of low scale (e.g 8 x 8) and in GANs the Generator part generates some random
noisy higher scale images (e.g 32 x 32) for each input image and the Discriminator based on the original
low scale image detects the desired image among the generated random noisy images.

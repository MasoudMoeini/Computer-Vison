Click on:<br/>
- IRgan.ipynb file to see the input data-images preprocessing <br/>
- FinalEvaluation_Main.ipynb file to see prediction model with GANs(two stream of CNN using tensorflow) and visulization.

If you are Intereseted to run the repository make sure that you have already jupyter nootbook and necessary python libraries installed at your pc.<br/>
1)Clone repository (Reference dataset CIFAR-10 https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html ) already was unpacked and included in repository <br/>
2)Run file: IRgan.ipynb  to prepare input data for purposed GANs model.<br>
3)Run Main file: FinalEvaluation_Main.ipynb <br>
